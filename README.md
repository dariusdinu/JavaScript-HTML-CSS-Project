	The main goal was creating an app for visualizing a dataset that consists of information 
about the GDP per capita, the Life Expectancy and the Population for the countries of the EU 
during 2000-2018. All data is stored in the media file based on another JSON file extracted from: 

--> https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/json-and-unicode-web-services/getting-started/rest-request

	Some key features:
* better understanding of the JavaScript programming language
* improving CSS and HTML skills
* understanging how a JSON file works
* using graphical elements such as SVG and Raster images
